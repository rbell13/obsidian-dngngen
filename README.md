# Obsidian DNGNGEN (MÖRK BORG) Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This is a simple plugin to parse the generated dungeons for the TTRPG [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) from [DNGNGEN](https://dngngen.makedatanotlore.dev/) into a nice format for Obsidian. It treats pasted text from the "COPY THIS" button at [DNGNGEN](https://dngngen.makedatanotlore.dev/) as a valid codeblock

## How to use

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-dngngen/`.
